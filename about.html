      <p>This thesis would be focusing on the <b>interactive evolution of artificial life art</b>, thus, one of the first fields of study to be discussed is <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life" target="_blank">artificial life</a></b> or the computer simulation of life. Artificial life (ALife, A-Life) is an academic discipline wherein studies related to natural life and existence were examined thoroughly by researchers. The examination of these processes is carried out using different computer simulations and machine learning. The said branch of knowledge was introduced and defined by an American computer scientist and as well a theoretical biologist in the late 80s, Christopher Langton.</p>

      <p>One of the most significant aspects for modern Artificial Life according to Alan Dorin, author of <b><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262818343_Biological_Bits_A_brief_guide_to_the_ideas_and_artefacts_of_computational_artificial_life" target="_blank">Biological Bits</a></b>, is the <b><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cellular-automata/" target="_blank">cellular automata</a></b> (CA). The term was introduced by John von Neumann in the 1950s, thanks to his fellow mathematician friend, Stanislaw Ulam’s suggestion when he was trying to create a computer program which can reproduce itself. The main goal on his study is to determine the type of cognitive connection’s fitness, wherein an automaton’s self-reproducing capacity will be present.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <p>Since this thesis is focusing on artificial life in art, the next topic to be discussed is a subfield of artificial intelligence which is an <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm" target="_blank">evolutionary algorithm</a></b> that aims to provide solutions to real world problems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <p>Evolutionary algorithms and their said family which can be identified into five (5) such as genetic algorithm (1), genetic programming (2), differential evolution, the evolution strategy and last but not the least, the evolutionary programming, are various techniques which are used and applied to different applications in the industry.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_evolutionary_computation" target="_blank">Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC)</a></b> is also called as <b>aesthetic selection</b> where the fitness evaluation is replaced by a human evaluation. This kind of human evaluation, from the word itself, is called aesthetic due to its assessment towards a particular object’s attractiveness and visual appeal.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <p>Every experiment in <b><a href="https://alife.org/encyclopedia/digital-evolution/introduction-to-digital-evolution/" target="_blank">digital evolution</a></b> is run and performed through what we referred as <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function" target="_blank">fitness function</a></b> in the world of artificial intelligence. In line with this, each experimenter has a clear and absolute objective being perceived which is contrast to <b><a href="https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/1296/how-does-novelty-search-work" target="_blank">novelty search</a></b> that is not driven by objectives.</p>
